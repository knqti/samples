In this sample, I revise Bio-Oregon's [BioVita Starter](https://bio-oregon.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Biovita-Starter.pdf) brochure. I also suggest improvements for the table graphics.

## Brochure Text

My first pass focuses on simple mistakes: spelling, grammar, etc. I use this chance to understand the product and its message.

My second pass focuses on clarity and consistency.

### First pass
