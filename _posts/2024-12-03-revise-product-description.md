In this sample, I revised the [BioVita Starter](https://bio-oregon.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Biovita-Starter.pdf) brochure text. I also suggest improvements for the table graphics.

## Brochure Text

My first pass focused on simple mistakes: spelling, grammar, etc. I used this chance to also understand the product and what the company is trying to convey.

My second pass focused on clarity and consistency.

### First pass

## Table Graphics

Suggestions:

- Add shadows behind white fonts to improve readability
- Use one format for units of measurements
- Change row background color to improve readability
