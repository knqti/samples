## Introduction

Importing has existed for as long as there have been borders. Different countries interact with each other, share ideas, and inevitably trade goods.

Consider the example: 

> An exotic flower has recently become popular within the country of Zion. However, the flower only grows on the tropical island of Atlantis. As a result, Zion businesses begin to import the flower from Atlantis and resell them to Zion citizens.

### Audience

## What is importing

Importing is the act of moving goods from one country into another. An importer is someone who is responsible for importing their respective goods. Importer responsibilities can be broken down into three broad steps known as the import procedure: 

1. Sourcing
2. Transportation
3. Customs clearance

## Import procedure

While importing specifics change over time and vary across industries, the overall procedure remains the same. Let's briefly explore each step.

### 1. Sourcing

"Sourcing" is another way to say "finding and acquiring goods". An importer sources from vendors in different countries.

> A Zion company, Flower Importer Inc. (FII), starts by looking for Atlantis vendors who sell the exotic flower. FII searches the internet, attends trade shows, and meets with potential vendors.

### 2. Transportation

Importers need to arrange how their goods will physically travel - by land, ocean, or air. In addition, *when* the goods travel is a key component of transportation too.

> After deciding on a vendor and placing an order, FII pays a transportation company to ship the flowers to Zion. They schedule the shipment to be delivered in Spring when customers tend to buy more flowers.

### 3. Customs clearance

Goods need to be approved by border authorities to enter into a country. This approval process is known as "clearing customs". In the United States, the border authorities are the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). 

In general, importers must provide CBP with documents that:

- Describe the goods
- Explain where the goods came from
- State how much the goods are worth

For more information on CBP requirements, [visit their website](https://www.cbp.gov/trade/basic-import-export).

> As FII's shipment of exotic flowers approaches Zion, FII provides the border authorities with the customs clearance documents. The border authorities approve and FII's shipment is allowed to enter Zion.

## Conclusion

To move goods from one country into another, an importer must go through the import procedure of sourcing, transportation, and customs clearance.
